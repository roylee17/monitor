# Interchain Security Monitor

An orchestration layer for Cosmos Interchain Security that automates validator operations and consumer chain deployments using a stateless, decentralized architecture.

## Overview

The Interchain Security Monitor acts as an autonomous orchestrator that:

- Monitors Cross-Chain Validation (CCV) module events from provider chains
- Automates validator opt-in/opt-out decisions for consumer chains
- Manages consumer chain lifecycle (spawn → operate → stop → delete)
- Operates independently without coordination between validators
- Uses stateless peer discovery for production deployments

## Key Features

- 🚀 **Automated Operations**: Handles validator opt-ins and consumer chain deployments automatically
- 🔄 **Stateless Design**: No shared state or coordination required between validators
- 🛡️ **Production Ready**: Battle-tested architecture for real validator infrastructure
- 📊 **Observable**: Comprehensive metrics, logging, and health checks
- 🔧 **Configurable**: Flexible deployment options for different environments

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)
- kubectl  
- Helm 3
- Go 1.21+ (for building from source)

### Deploy a Test Network

The monitor uses Helm charts for deployment. The testnet creates 3 validators across 3 Kind clusters:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/monitor.git
cd monitor

# 2. Deploy a 3-validator testnet
make deploy  # This uses Helm to deploy each validator

# 3. Check deployment status
make status

# 4. Create a test consumer chain
make create-consumer

# 5. View monitor logs
make logs TARGET=alice COMPONENT=monitor
```

### Deploy a Single Validator

For production validators, use the Helm chart directly:

```bash
# Create your configuration
cat > my-validator.yaml <<EOF
validator:
  name: myvalidator
  moniker: "My Validator"
keys:
  mnemonic: "your mnemonic..."
chain:
  genesis:
    url: "https://example.com/genesis.json"
peers:
  persistent: ["node-id@peer:26656"]
EOF

# Deploy
helm install myvalidator ./helm/ics-validator -f my-validator.yaml
```

See the [Helm Deployment Guide](docs/helm-deployment-guide.md) for details.

### Multi-Cluster Architecture

Each validator runs in its own Kind cluster to simulate real-world deployments:

```bash
# Cluster management
make create-clusters                  # Create 3 Kind clusters
make delete-clusters                  # Delete all clusters
make reset                           # Full reset and redeploy

# View logs from specific clusters
make logs TARGET=alice COMPONENT=monitor     # Alice's monitor
make logs TARGET=bob COMPONENT=validator     # Bob's validator

# Access specific cluster
make shell TARGET=charlie            # Shell into Charlie's validator

# Consumer chain operations
make list-consumers                  # List all consumer chains
make consumer-status CONSUMER_ID=0   # Check consumer status
make remove-consumer CONSUMER_ID=0   # Remove a consumer chain
```

For detailed instructions, see the [Installation Guide](docs/operations/installation.md).

## System Architecture

The monitor system operates with complete validator independence:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Provider Chain"
        PC[Provider Chain]
    end
    
    subgraph "Validator A"
        MA[Monitor A]
        CA[Consumer Chains A]
    end
    
    subgraph "Validator B"
        MB[Monitor B]
        CB[Consumer Chains B]
    end
    
    PC -->|Events| MA
    PC -->|Events| MB
    MA -->|Deploy| CA
    MB -->|Deploy| CB
    CA -.->|P2P| CB
```

Each validator:
- Runs their own monitor instance
- Makes independent decisions
- Deploys their own consumer chain infrastructure
- No coordination or shared state required
